# Formatting Input and Output Using Inquirer and Rich

## Challenge

As you've probably seen, **terminal input and output** in Python is quite basic... **until now!** ðŸš€

With **Inquirer**, we can create a more flexible and user-friendly input experience.  
With **Rich**, we can enhance output with **tables, colors, and even progress bars!**

In this exercise, you will:

- Use **Inquirer** to create **interactive prompts** for user input.
- Use **Rich** to format the output, displaying **tables, colored text, and a progress bar**.

## Key Learnings

- How to **use third-party Python libraries** to improve console applications.
- How to **enhance user input** using `InquirerPy`.
- How to **format and style output** using `Rich`.

## User Story

As a developer,  
I want to create a more engaging terminal experience,  
So that users can interact with my Python scripts more effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Use **Inquirer** to prompt the user for their **name and favorite color**.
- Use **Rich** to:
  - Print a **welcome message** in the user's favorite color.
  - Display a **table of sample data**.
  - Show a **progress bar** while simulating a loading task.

## Example Usage

### **1. Setting Up the Environment**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
